CMP0052
-------

Use new variable expansion rules.

CMake 3.0 and lower used an older, slower implementation of variable expansion
which offered some behavior no longer allowed by the new parser. Specifically,
'@' expansion is no longer performed in files not configured using
:command:`configure_file` or the CONFIGURE signature of :command:`string` and
literal variable names are restricted to alphanumerics and the characters
"./-+" and in environment variables "()" are also allowed. If variables with
other characters are required, use

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(varname "disallowschars&")
  message("${${varname}}")

This policy also enforces :policy:`CMP0010` unconditionally.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to use the old variable expansion parser.
The NEW behavior is to use the new variable expansion rules.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1. CMake version |release| warns
when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy
command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.
